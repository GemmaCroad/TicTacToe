Rules of Tic Tac Toe:
“Takes two platers, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.”


Technical Requirements

Your app must:
- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"cat’s game" if neither wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


Things to think about:
-	MAKE IT WORK AND THEN MAKE IT PRETTY!
-   work out how to draw a 3 x 3 grid nicely and fairly easily
-   work out the logic on paper for winning combinations (ALL OF THEM)
-	needs to be 2 player and alternate turns between players, once player 1 has played then it is player 2’s turn, etc.
-	will have to know when a square has already been taken, and by which player
-	will need to know when a player has won - display winner
-	? (to think about later) > keep tally of winners over multiple games
-	display which player won the round
-	clear board function between games so another round can be played - ? button 
-	What is the best way to store the data? 
-	? use alert statements – prettier way to do this
-	get computer to act as player two and perform a random move – using an available space
-	should show markers when user clicks in the square (correct marker for each player)
-   work out how to syle the thing and make it looks awesome!

Array of winning answers?
Startwith the board as an empty array when player moves ammend the array
have another array of winning combinations?
